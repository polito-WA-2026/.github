## Exam rules

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: *EXAM DATE*: The oral discussion typically is **NOT** on the official date of the exam, but in the next few days. Ask the teacher if in doubt, especially before booking travels! Failure to show up in person at the discussion automatically results in exam failure.


The exam consists of a web application project to be developed according to the specifications published about 20 days in advance of each official exam date ("data appello"), plus an oral discussion of such a project. For each official date, a new assignment is given and must be developed.

The web application project must be developed during the 20 days by each student INDIVIDUALLY. During the oral discussion, each student should be able to prove that they were able to develop the project in full autonomy by showing complete and full knowledge of every part of their submitted solution. Failure to do so will result in exam failure.

The final version of the project must be submitted before the deadline, according to the provided technical instructions. If such instructions are not carefully followed, the exam will be considered failed. This includes, for instance, if the project cannot be run and tested as-is by the teacher with the required configuration.

After publishing the assignment the teachers will be available (via Telegram or similar means) for about 7 days to discuss potential doubts (e.g., unclear or ambiguous requirements). Any student will be able to ask questions asynchronously. After such a clarification phase, the "final" version of the text will be published, clarifying the more ambiguous aspects raised in the previous 7 days. After that time and before the deadline the teachers will still be available (via Telegram or similar means) for clarifications.

The submission deadline for the project is at 23:59 (Italy time) of the day before the official exam date. To submit the exam, it is mandatory enroll in the exam through the booking procedure ("prenotazione esami"). The students admitted to the exam will be those that are correctly enrolled AND have turned in the project before the deadline. There will be no penalty for students who enroll but do not submit the project (they will be marked as "absent"). However, to facilitate planning of the oral discussions, please remove booking as soon as you know that you will not submit (deleting a booking can be done at any time before the deadline).

The submitted projects will be evaluated during the oral discussion. The evaluation criteria for the submitted project will be the ones detailed during the first lecture of the course (see recordings if needed).

Each student will be allocated a day and a time slot for the discussion, that must take place in person (as per university regulations). The schedule will be prepared AFTER the deadline. Some form of identification is required. As per university regulations, the Polito ID card is enough. If missing, other official IDs such as passport, etc. can also be accepted. The oral discussion aims to ensure that each student developed the web application by themselves and to evaluate how much the student can explain the exact behavior of the code. The source code will be opened and run on the teacher's computer (Linux server) to ensure that what is run and commented is the actual submitted code.

During the oral discussion the student must be able to explain every aspect of the project. This includes, but is not limited to, the reasons behind the architectural choices for their application, how any specific fragment of code works, why it was implemented in that way, what alternatives could have been used, etc.

Since the exam is essentially the design of an application with rather generic specifications, it is not acceptable that the submitted solutions are excessively similar among them, which would indicate that the solution has not been developed autonomously. **Similarity checks will be run after the deadline using an automated software**. In case of excessive similarity, after manual review by the teachers to avoid false positives, the exam will be considered failed, and the students will be notified by email about the situation.

#### Recommendations

During the orale discussion each student must be able to immediately find and carefully explain any part of the code in the project that implements a given feature asked by the teacher. Therefore, we recommended that the student carefully rehearse and review the code shortly before the oral discussion.

As in any programming assignment to be developed at home, it is possible to search online for suggestions and examples about how to solve specific programming issues during the development phase, which can be incorporated into the final solution. However, regardless of the source, the student MUST be able to explain how the code submitted as the final solution works. This applies to anything, regardless of the source (online examples, templates, AI suggestions, etc.). 

Not being able to explain any code behavior, especially suspicious code, immediately leads to exam FAILURE, even if the submitted application has not yet been tested.  Note that anything not seen during lectures is SUSPECT by default and it will be investigated in very much detail.  All submitted projects will be pre-screened for unusual (suspect) programming patterns/functions/libraries/content etc.: typically, oral discussion will start from them.

In the solution, it is recommended to employ all the good practices and sound programming techniques explained during the lectures. Substantial deviations from such patterns will have to be duly justified during the oral exam. If not adequately justified or if the justification is not relevant or incorrect, they will cause a reduction of the final mark and potentially a failed exam especially when security aspects are involved.

Regarding the use of external libraries/templates/modules: as a general rule, the use of the techniques and libraries shown during the lectures/labs is preferred. The use of external modules and libraries for functions such as date/time handling, presentation aspects, predefined components (e.g., calendars), and similar items are allowed.

If React requires certain programming patterns, those must be followed. For example, it is NOT allowed to use JQuery or JS directly to modify DOM content within the browser. It is not allowed to use server-side technologies other than those shown in the lectures. All solutions must use Express, with SQLite to implement DB access, and the React internal web server to serve the initial web page. Also, remember that the solution MUST be submitted in a way that can be readily tested by the teacher with the commands specified in the technical instructions.
